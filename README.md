## Jets Application Project

### Week 3 Homework Project for Skill Distillery

### Overview

#### In this project, I made a Jet class that extended to three child Jet classes that each had different capabilities. Building this program tested my ability to scale between classes to call methods and to pull data from one another.

### Steps Of The Application

#### Upon starting up the program, information from a separate text file with information of five jets is read and inputed into an array list. Next, the user is prompted with a menu that lists nine options. Option 1: lists all jets that are loaded into the application and any that have been added. Option 2: prints out all data of the jets and includes how long each jet can fly based on speed and length of trip. Option 3: prints out the fastest jet there is in the list along with all of that specific jets' data. Option 4: prints out the jet that can go the farthest and all of its data. Option 5: loads all of the cargo type jets. Option 6: fighter jets are ready to fight. Option 7: allows the user to enter a new jet into the array list along with the jets capabilities. Option 8: allows the user to remove any jet from the array list. Option 9: quits the program.

### Lessons Learned

#### 1. Array lists have different call methods compared to arrays. Using an array list so far seems to be very good with adding new data into it and has a few ways that it can organize the data.

#### 2. Getting a program to read separate data from a text file is not the easiest process. I had trouble figuring out how to not only pull data from a text file, but to also get my program to be able to read that data and separate the strings, integers, longs, and doubles from one another.
